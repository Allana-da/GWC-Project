      HELLO! I am the creator of the BLUEMOON, my name is Allana. I love playing tennis, coding, crochet, and playing solitaire. The one thing they all have in common is music, I love listening to music. I make the perfect playlist that is based on the mood, the time, and also the moment. When I am about to play tennis, I mostly listen to music that pumps my blood, it gives me energy, but I tend to mix in a little nostalgia to get the satisfying feeling I get when I play tennis. </p>
    <p>I explored various fields of Computer Science to be able to find the one thing that peaked my interest </p>

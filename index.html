      HELLO! I am the creator of the BLUEMOON, my name is Allana. I love playing tennis, crochet, and playing solitaire. The one thing they all have in common is music, I love listening to music. I make the perfect that is based on the mood, the time, and also the moment. When I am about to play tennis, I mostly listen to music that pumps my blood, it gives me energy, but I tend to mix in a little nostalgia to get the satisfying feeling I get when I play tennis. This website is for those who get stuck when they donâ€™t know what to listen to. BLUEMOON is a website with some of the best playlists for the perfect moments.

    <h2>3D model tennis racket</h2>
  <img src="assets/RacketModel.png" alt="It is a 3D model of a tennis racquet created to be printed out in 3D.">
  <p>I created this 3D tennis racket model through Fusion 360. I did this at the Rice Elite Tech camp. It was my first time doing something other than coding, and the model showed the amount of effort I put into creating the art. </p>

    
  <h2>Animation Work</h2>
    <img src="assets/looneyTunes.gif" alt="A pixelated animation image of bugs bunny and Road Runner. The image of bugs bunny and Road Runner switching.">
    <p>This is the proudest work I've ever done in Python. Even though I used the basic code of Python of animation, it was something that was not easy to accomplish. I had to pay close attention to the pixels and be able to switch from Bugs bunny to Road Runner. </p>
